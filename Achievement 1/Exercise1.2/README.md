Exercise 1.2

Task

- name(str): Contains the name of the recipe
- cooking_time(int): Contains the cooking time in minutes
- ingredients(list): Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

I would use a dictionary data structure to create a structure named recipe_1 with the specified keys. A dictionary allows me to store key-value pairs, where the keys represent the names of the recipe, cooking time, and ingredients. The values represent the corresponding data types (str for name, int for cooking_time, and list of str for ingredients). This allows for easy access and retrieval of specific information within the structure.

all_recipes = []

I would use a list data structure to create the outer structure all_recipes and add recipe_1 to it. A list allows for sequential elements storage, making it suitable for storing multiple recipes. Each recipe can be added to the list, allowing for easy modification and retrieval of recipes as required.
